I am now a joint Ph.D. candidate in the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by [Rui Zhao](https://zhaorui.xyz/). I am also fortunate to be co-advised by [Rui Su](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=tLLmRBwAAAAJ) and [Lei Bai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=sakOO04AAAAJ) at the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

I received my B.S. degree in Geophysics from the School of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Science and Technology of China, where I was advised by [Prof. Junlun Li](https://ess.ustc.edu.cn/2022/0929/c32208a588693/page.htm).

My research interests lie in developing AI-driven methods for geophysical data analysis, with a particular focus on seismic data processing, remote sensing interpretation, and geophysical inversion techniques, including Full Waveform Inversion and Surface Wave Inversion.
